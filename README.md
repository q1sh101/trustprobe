Read-only firmware trust posture auditor for Linux. Single C11 binary, no
daemon, zero third-party deps.

bythos does not harden. It reads, classifies, prints, exits.

## Mini example

Plain output is colored in a terminal; `--json` emits the same tree for CI and posture diffs.

$ sudo bythos

    tpm:

      ok    PCR 7  non-zero; Secure Boot state measured

    platform firmware:

    fwupd:
      ok    HSI: Boot Guard               enabled and verified
      ok    HSI: pre-boot DMA protection  active
```

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/q1sh101/bythos
cd bythos && make && sudo make install

sudo bythos       # requires root for full coverage
bythos --json     # machine-readable output
bythos --help
bythos --version
```

Install paths can be overridden with `prefix`, `bindir`, `mandir`, `DESTDIR`.
Remove with `sudo make uninstall`.

## How It Works

**bythos opens no sockets, writes no files, runs no shell, and ignores `$PATH`.**
Helpers are spawned via `fork` + `execvp` against a compile-time PATH; their
output is captured through a bounded pipe with a 10-second timeout and parsed
by hand-written C parsers.

PE/COFF parsing extracts `.sbat` from installed shim/grub binaries. JSON
output escapes control characters and invalid UTF-8. Each subgroup has a fixed
result capacity; overflow is flagged as truncated in both outputs.

## Optional Helpers

bythos reads kernel-exposed state without extra packages. Helpers expand
coverage:

| Helper       | Adds coverage for                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `fwupdmgr`   | HSI signals, firmware inventory, update status     |
| `mokutil`    | Secure Boot state, MOK enrollments, db/dbx, SBAT   |
| `sbctl`      | Secure Boot owner GUID and vendor-key state        |
| `tpm2-tools` | TPM PCR reads and dictionary-attack lockout policy |
| `dmidecode`  | SMBIOS firmware password status                    |

Narrower probes also use `cryptsetup`, `lsblk`, `pesign`, `sha256sum`, and
`systemctl`. `chipsec` and `spectre-meltdown-checker` are detected for
availability only. Missing helpers degrade their checks to `skip`, never `fail`.

## Output States

| State  | Meaning                                      |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| `ok`   | Expected posture was observed                |
| `warn` | Weaker posture, stale state, or softer risk  |
| `fail` | Direct posture regression                    |
| `skip` | Not applicable or not observable on this run |

`skip` is not a hidden pass. It means bythos could not make that observation:
hardware absent, helper missing, field absent, root required, vendor mismatch,
or output unparseable, among other typed reasons (full list in `man bythos`).

Plain output uses lowercase labels. `--json` capitalizes them (`OK`, `WARN`,
`FAIL`, `SKIP`) and adds a `skip_reason` field per row. Exit codes are
listed in the overview at the top.

## Comparison

| Tool       | Layer                       | Best at                         | Footprint             |
|------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **bythos** | UEFI / TPM / DMA / EFI vars | Firmware trust posture report   | read-only, userland   |
| lynis      | OS configuration            | Compliance hardening sweep      | read-only, user/root  |
| aide       | Filesystem hashes           | Post-deploy integrity tripwire  | writes hash DB, root  |
| chkrootkit | Known-bad signatures        | Userland rootkit detection      | read-only, root       |
| fwupdmgr   | LVFS + HSI subset           | Firmware updates and HSI report | writes firmware, root |
| fwts       | ACPI / SMBIOS / UEFI tests  | Firmware compliance test suite  | read-only, root       |
| chipsec    | SMI / SMM / SPI flash       | Deep firmware research audit    | kernel module, root   |

chipsec goes deeper and needs lower-level access. bythos stays in userland and
reads what Linux already exposes.

## Requirements

**Runtime**:
- Linux 5.x or newer
- UEFI host recommended
- x86_64 primary; ARM64 coverage is narrower

**Build**:
- glibc or musl
- GNU Make and a C11 compiler

On legacy BIOS hosts and inside containers, most firmware paths are
unavailable; bythos still completes, marking missing checks as `skip` and
flagging absent EFI runtime as `warn`.

## Limitations

- Pre-OS firmware internals (SMI / SMM / SPI flash) are not exposed by Linux and are invisible to bythos.
- Versions and posture only - not a CVE scanner.
- Hash comparisons confirm file identity, not Authenticode chain validity.
- BMC / IPMI / iLO / iDRAC management plane is out of scope.
- PCR reads are local observations; remote attestation is out of scope.
- ACPI / SMBIOS structural validation is out of scope (see `fwts`).
- Userland security (processes, memory, network) is out of scope.

## Build and Test

```bash
make          # build bythos
make ci-test  # unit suite
make smoke    # end-to-end smoke test
make asan     # ASan + UBSan unit suite
```

The default build uses `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Werror`,
`-fstack-protector-strong`, `_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`, PIE, RELRO, now binding, and
non-executable stack linker flags. ASan and UBSan are clean on the unit suite
and live binary.
